AI-Enhanced Personalized Learning and Career Pathway Platform

In today’s fast-paced educational environment, students often struggle with managing their studies effectively while also preparing for future careers. Traditional learning platforms provide content but fail to offer personalized guidance tailored to individual strengths, weaknesses, and learning styles.
This project proposes an AI-driven platform that generates personalized learning paths based on a student’s course syllabus, performance, and study preferences. Additionally, the platform includes career readiness features, such as skill recommendations, certificate suggestions, an interactive resume builder, and an AI-powered interview preparation module.
  The platform’s key objectives are:
    •	Optimize academic learning through AI-generated weekly study plans.
    •	Support long-term career planning with personalized skill and certification guidance.
    •	Provide tools to prepare resumes and practice interviews efficiently.
The project combines AI, analytics, and user-centered design to enhance both academic performance and career readiness.
